The Ditch is a 3-4 feet deep hole located at [[The_FOB]]. The Ditch was, at one point, covered in a roof of wood and tarp. This roof was high enough to enable shorter people, such as [[Shane]] to stand. This tarp from the roof has since been cannibalized by for a currently abandoned project, [[FOB_2]].
