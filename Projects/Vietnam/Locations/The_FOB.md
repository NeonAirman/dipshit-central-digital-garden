The FOB or The Forward Operating Base refers to an area under a bridge right across an area of wetlands nicknamed [[The_Bog]]. The FOB can also apply to any area close by.

The FOB was originally established by [[Shane]] & [[Jake]].

The FOB is the usual area for construction, with its largest project being [[The_Ditch]]. This is also the location where fires are mostly hosted, as the entire area is covered orange sand.
